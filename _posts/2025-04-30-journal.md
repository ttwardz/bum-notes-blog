I’ve realized that any night out at a bar when I discover or rediscover even one new song is a successful night. Tonight’s is Girls and Boys by Blur.

A few weeks ago at the same bar was Dead Flowers by the Stones.

<!-- Note to self and the other nerds reading the HTML: the bar was Swift Hibernian Lounge on E 4th St Manhattan -->
