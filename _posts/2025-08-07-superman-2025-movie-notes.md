Superman job description: Primarily catching heavy things before they fall on people.

The movie: I liked it.

My reference for Superman is the Justice League animated show in the 90s/00s, so this one's a bit goofier than what I tend to expect. But he's fun, has a bit of depth, and his chemistry with Lois is fantastic.

Sooo, I guess the DC Universe is over?

Why does every superhero movie need inter-dimensional rifts and space-warping alternate universes? At least there was no time travel in this one.

But there was a *code* to close the rift?? What does that even mean? I guess that is a very comic-book-style plot device, which fine. But why?

*

Must I always gravitate toward the superhero movies where, by the end, the hero hasn't even averted the disaster (see: The Batman) but at least they defeated the villain and it's the glimmer of *hope* that counts as a triumphant resolution?

*

Just a funny thought: Superman is raised by loving active parents and grows into an optimistic hopeful trusting adult ("maybe that's the real punk") and Batman watches his parents get murdered in front of him by a stranger and starts dressing like a bat and slinking around at night and neglecting all social relationships and responsibilities.
