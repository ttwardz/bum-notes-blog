# This Is Definitely the Real Song Mr. Krabs Was Trying to Request on the Radio

This song showed up in my New Music Mix from Apple Music this week, and you can’t tell me it’s not “Beep Boo Boo Bop”.

Blue Skies (feat. John Talabot & Velmondo) by Mioclono 
([Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/album/blue-skies-feat-john-talabot-velmondo/1653972717?i=1653972718) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/1vx0vqCUg0fxAzy1oSRAzE?si=77a628f4afeb4bcb))
