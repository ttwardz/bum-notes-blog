# The 5 Most Exciting Artists of the Moment
*Updated March 11, 2025*

Exciting music from a few great bands.

## 1. Hinds

Hinds at Warsaw is I think one of my favorite concerts ever. The purest kind of fun joyous rock and roll. Apparently not even their first time playing there! I met one person who'd seen them there last time and am jealous. But not that jealous, because the songs from the albums that've come since packed the setlist with great singalongs and messy party energy.



Songs to start with:
- Just Like Kids
- Coffee
- Spanish Bombs (The Clash cover) (Apple Music | Spotify)

## 2. SKORTS

Seen 'em four times now, same setlist, sometimes opening, sometimes headlining, once in a park in the sun, another time in a bowling alley, another time at Webster Hall. They're big.

The sound 
The vocals and harmonies are everything. The vocals, I mean... they're gigantic. That's what got me the first time I saw them.

Their sound reminds me a little of Wolf Alice, where it sweeps from punchy and tight to huge and spacey and epic.

Songs to start with:
- Steal the Night

## 3. Doechii

Everybody cool probably already knew about Doechii but here I am really finding out from a Tiny Desk Concert (one of the best I've seen) and, yeah, obsessed.

Songs to start with:
- DENIAL IS A RIVER (Apple Music | Spotify)
- NISSAN ALTIMA (Apple Music | Spotify)
- WAIT (Apple Music | Spotify)
- Balloon (Tyler the Creator feat. Doechii) (Apple Music | Spotify)

## 4.

## 5. Miss Grit

I saw Miss Grit open for The Last Dinner Party at ==Brooklyn Steel== and I had no idea she was already performing while I was ordering a beer because the music was so ambient and ==mellow== and *now* that my brain took it in as the venue's music. None of which I mean as negatives. I just didn't know, and then I walked inside, and there she was alone on stage with a computer or a synth or something on a stand and her guitar and a microphone.

For a couple songs, she stood there and played and sang along with the backing track and I became transfixed.

"Talk Talk" is a perfect example of the catchy, shimmering melodies and punctuating synths.

Songs to start with:
- Talk Talk (Apple Music | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/4ob4h8LBUxRrdy1UmJFU4j?si=b85cc864e5cd4e00))
- Imposter (Apple Music | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/75RFwKV6wjJiCQmuoUY69f?si=0ffe69955b16492b))
