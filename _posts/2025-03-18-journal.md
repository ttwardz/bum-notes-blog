I was looking through a stack of Bionicle comics from years ago as a form of procrastination a few weeks ago. And in the same pile I found a comic book I'd started writing as a kid. WAR. A story about an alien invasion.

Doesn't look like I got further than the cover art for issue #1, the first page, and the inside back cover art teasing issue #2.

BUT: peep the highly detailed weather report to open the series.
