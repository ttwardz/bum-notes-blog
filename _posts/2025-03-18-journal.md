I was looking through the stack of Bionicle comics from years ago as a form of procrastination today. And then I found a comic book I'd started writing as a kid. WAR. A story about an alien invasion. Although it doesn't look like I got further than the cover art for issue #1, the first page, and the inside back cover art teasing issue #2.
