[Rec](https://www.pi.fyi/rec/cmbshnnil0143su41isefnit4): *Brideshead Revisited* by Evelyn Waugh

This book is such a wild ride from vigorous indulgence to immaturity banging up against reality to a gorgeous love story and war and religion and loss and loneliness.

First time through, I couldn't get enough of Charles's and Sebastian's college partying, ridiculous pretentiousness, and deep friendship/romance.

The last time through, I absolutely lost myself in Charles's adult love story, climaxing onboard the ship.

And then this line:

> Our two lives, so long widely separate, now being knit to one.

So, so beautiful.

Waugh's an incredible writer and there's a lot of very dry funny stuff in between the heaviness.
