Rec: Being in water with clothes on

A lil anarchy, a little bit of a mess, very fun 

Always loved movies and TV where people are jumping into water and otherwise getting wet with their clothes on

Pirates of the Caribbean was a big one for this. So many layers of clothing and gear, so much water. Crocodile Hunter was another one (Collision Course allllll day)

Maybe that's part of why I love Baywatch so much

Just spent a couple days splashing around in the ocean riding waves with a sun shirt on and feeling this vibe

Oh and dancing in the pouring rain absolutely counts | [PI.FYI](https://www.pi.fyi/rec/cmdkigd910frdrr415kzd38gh)
